                <p>In the previous semester, I was one of the appointed Executive Committee by our late Sir Reynold Luna. Being the Finance Chair, I wasn’t just limited in handling the organization’s funds but I, together with my co-officers, was also strategically planning <strong>The Quantum: Reborn</strong>, together with my co-officers, aside from extensive meetings and executions for so many events. </p>
                <P>As we were sorting things and massive stacks of papers of the organization, we came across an old publication, The Quantum, dated way back in 2011. Immediately, as the speed of light, kidding (nothing can still attain that), a burst of eagerness and excitement of my electrons kicked in me.</p>
                <!-- Subsection -->
                <h2>Story Behind The Quantum: Reborn</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>As an active journalist since elementary and also a previous Editor-in-Chief of The Auroranians, our highschool’s publication, journalism has been a part of me, even though it sounds really cheesy. And I knew that I am not alone in this Society. Being an officer made me to be acquainted to the Society’s members and the diversity I witnessed was  colorful and full of expectations and potentials. We, upon consulting Sir Cyrus J. Ayala, our Adviser, then raised the movement of the publication to the members, to make it a venue for journalists in this Physics field we have tread.</p>
                <p>We were also inspired by Sir Ron Palacio, the previous Editor-in-Chief of The Quantum (2011), when he told us to pursue it. It was nice meeting him, like the conjunction of Venus and Jupiter, because he did not only helped us reviving this publication but as well as in leading the organization as a whole.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, our late Sir Reynold Luna has also mentioned The Quantum when he was still with us. However, we were still little buds in the pond of (yeah, heaven) Physics, adjusting in our academics and officership. But now that we got the hang of academics and being an officer, plus the extensive support the Alumni have showed us, we are now more than dedicated to reignite the journalists in this Society. </p>
                <p>The Quantum’s Mission remains the same. <br>The Quantum commits itself to provide students with information through unbiased journalism and relevant news and features in science community and researches.</p>
                <p>The positive response of the Society made this publication a reality, a living and breathing one. It was quite challenging to finally launch this publication because of academic priorities and other facets of life we are all busy with. I wish to take this opportunity to thank all the force and creative minds behind this publication. Let us make this publication not just a vent for our skills and talents but may our vision for this publication to be the soul of the Physics Society.</p>

                <p>When you were a kid, have you ever dreamed to become an astronaut and venture the cosmos inside a vessel off of Earth’s gravity? Schools and social media are perceived as one of the many platforms which inspires kids and even adults pursue careers in the field of space science.</p>
                <p>August 8, 2019 was the day the Philippines has officially made its ambitious leap in the space race. It was the day when President Duterte had approved the Philippine Space Agency Act under the Republic Act 11363.</p>
                <p><strong>Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA)</strong>, with its initial funding worth 10 billion spread over five years, will support the research and development programs with an aim to improve the lives of Filipinos as well as enhancing the country’s version of NASA and national security.</p>

                <p>Evolution may have wired us to make connections. <br>Like how all these organic materials in me are linked.<br>Connections that we intend and don't intend<br>Connections we keep and break.</p>
                <p>Amidst all these mixed faces in the crowd<br>Like how heterogeneous blood is,<br>Being alone doesn't define loneliness<br>And loneliness doesn't define being alone.</p>
                <p>Being connected doesn't always look like <br>Being one with the crowd<br>Nor being surrounded with companions <br>Sometimes, it looks like being connected with your inner self and nothing less.</p>
                <p>All the motions that seems like uncontrollable bumping electrons<br>All the noise that seems to be more than 80 dB <br>I feel like an atom forced to jump to a higher energy level <br>it was too agitating, an escape velocity is all I need.</p>
                <p>My heart longs for white noise and calmness<br>The oscillating and crashing sound of the sea's blue waves <br>To flow with the breath of the cave's stalagmites.<br>To stare at the lovely celestial bodies under the pitch-dark sky</p>
