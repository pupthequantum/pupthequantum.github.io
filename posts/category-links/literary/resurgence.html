            <p>During its first phase of ‘resurrection’, we like to call it that way; I didn’t become the EIC until a few months because I was also the Finance Chair of the organization that time. Gifford Villanueva, our very dear and first EIC, well in our time, took the responsibility of gathering contributors and technical team. Our team was formed amidst our academic and social responsibilities and other personal matters. We pulled it all through and I am forever thankful for the hands that wrote articles and for the ancient HTML codes in our github site by John Chew.</p>
