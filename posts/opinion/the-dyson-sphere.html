      <p>In the modern era, almost all of us rely on technology to keep our lives running. Such technology requires energy to operate, so as our civilization expands and our technology improves, so too does our need for more energy.</p>
      <p>Energy sources used to come from coal, then oil and natural gas, then nuclear fission, then to renewable sources, and, if we can harness it, then we could have nuclear fusion as our new source of energy. But such sources can only bring human civilization to a limit.</p>
      <p>As we venture out into space, looking for new places to explore and new planets to potentially live, we’re limited to what amount of energy we could use to explore into the vastness of space, what we need is an almost limitless source of energy, which we could harness for as long as human civilization can endure.  Luckily, we know of a place: the Sun.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor. It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second,”</p>
        <p>– Kurzgesagt, In a Nutshell (2018).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Sun’s enormous amounts of energy can drastically change the progress of human civilization by orders of magnitude, never before imagined by any human on Earth. But a big step to getting the Sun’s energy is how to harness it, not make one here on Earth, but directly harness it. The solution would be a Dyson Sphere.</p>
      <p>Conceptualized by Freeman Dyson, a Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that covers an entire star to harness the energy that it releases. How it works, basically, is that a megastructure surrounds the Sun to collect the energy that it releases, then it beams or delivers that energy to Earth for human use.</p>
      <p>Such a structure would require tons and tons of material, so much so that it an entire planet has to be completely disassembled just to accomplish just a portion of the megastructure itself.</p>
      <p>There are three types of Dyson Spheres, the Dyson shell that is the most known in science fiction, is a type of sphere in which the entire star is enclosed in a solid spherical structure, while a Dyson bubble consists of stationary satellites that cover the entire star, and a Dyson swarm is a swarm of satellites that revolve around the star by rings. The Dyson shell is the most unrealistic type since such structure is vulnerable to impacts, which could cause it to drift towards the Sun. The Dyson bubble is also unrealistic because objects in space continue to move when force is applied to them since space is a free-flowing vacuum. Which leads us to the most viable option, the Dyson swarm, because it will just use the Sun’s gravity to orbit itself around the Sun, it’s also the cheapest option out of the three types since you just need mirrors bound to some support structures to refocus sunlight to solar collectors, which will store the energy produced by the Sun.</p>
      <p>Now that the Dyson swarm is the chosen candidate for a theoretical Dyson sphere, what would it take to build it? Well, if we put the scale of each satellite mirror at one kilometer, then we would need about thirty quadrillion to surround the Sun, then if built lightly, it would require one hundred quintillion tons of material, and we would need the energy and the infrastructure set up to send the satellite mirrors in their positions surrounding the Sun.</p>
      <p>For the material, it would take a planet to make a portion of the satellite mirror swarms, so the best candidate planet would be Mercury, since it is the closest to the Sun, has gravity lower than the Earth’s, and it is very metal rich, but it would actually take the disassembly of the inner planets and the asteroid belt for a complete Dyson swarm.</p>
      <p>For the energy, it would actually take the production of a single satellite mirror to produce another, then those two make two more, then they become eight, then sixteen and so on, and will keep doubling until the planet Mercury is completely disassembled.</p>
      <p>For the Infrastructure, Mercury is subject to harsh conditions, so the mining of the resources and the production and delivery of the satellite mirrors would most likely be run on automation, with oversight from few people and the delivery of the satellite mirrors into orbit would most likely be done via a long electromagnetic railgun, since Mercury’s gravity is light.</p>
      <p>Even if it would just be a portion and not an entire swarm covering the Sun, if the swarm could capture one percent’s of the Sun’s power, then that would already be a huge energy surplus, four terajoules per second to be exact, that would benefit the Earth and Human civilization on a scale never seen before, we could make colonies on new worlds, try to terraform planets like Mars and Venus, create new technologies never seen before, go to places farther than the Solar system, and the list goes on and on. If we could set aside our own differences and work together for this project, then we could be, as far as we know, the first multiplanetary species in space — the final frontier.</p>
