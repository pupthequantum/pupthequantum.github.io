      <p>We humans have come a long way since our first appearance 100,000 years ago. Technology came and went, from simple tools to complex machinery. The concept of society, of humans gathering together to coexist, raised civilizations from valleys and riverbanks. We have learned to harness and utilize energy, allowing us to do things outside our biological capabilities. These three factors are interconnected; energy allows us to develop more advanced technology, which will then uplift our civilization, much like what happened when we started to use steam engines in the Industrial Revolution. This interconnection contributed to where we are now today, and Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev had something to say about it.</p>
      <p>Kardashev developed a method to gauge a civilization’s technological advancement based on the amount of energy they are able to use, a method that would be called the Kardashev scale. This scale rates a civilization into three types: Type I to Type III. Type I civilizations can harness and store all the available energy on their planet, Type II civilizations up the scales by controlling all the available energy of a planetary system, and Type III civilizations stand on top with the ability to utilize all the available energy of an entire galaxy. Placing us humans on this scale would be quite underwhelming; our civilization hasn’t even reached the status of a Type I yet.</p>
      <p>How can we progress further? As it is now, obtaining the Type I status is but a pipe dream. Undertaking the colossal task of claiming all the planet’s energy for our use requires the cooperation of, at the very least, all first-world countries. A massive venture like this is doomed to fail at the slightest hint of malefic intention from those that will participate in it; after all, possessing such a huge amount of energy entails rapid progress in sectors like the industry and military. Vested interests have no place in our advancement as a civilization.</p>
      <p>We humans have come a long way indeed. We went from sticks and stones to 3D printed materials, from walking around Earth to venturing out into outer space. We have banded together as a species, forming nations and prospering. But we also have divided ourselves for self-centered reasons, and if we are to move up the Kardashev scale, we need to do it as a collective with a unified purpose.</p>
