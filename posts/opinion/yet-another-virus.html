            <p>The occurring transmission isn’t that of the virus alone, but also that of the stigma and discrimination coupled with it.</p>
            <p><strong>On March 11, 2020</strong>, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the imminent outbreak of COVID-19, a viral disease originating from Wuhan, China, as a global pandemic – sweeping the global arena in just a number of months. However, as we go further along the quarantine period, it is evident that the declared virus is not the only new disease which we are fighting.</p>
            <p>Just days following the lockdown in various countries, there has been reports of racial discrimination against people of Asian descent and numerous acts of discrimination directed towards the frontliners, COVID-19 patients and survivors, and individuals suspected of carrying the disease.</p>
            <p>In the originating country, Chinese authorities have reportedly used intrusive containment measures such as barricading the doors of suspected infected families with metal poles, according to the non government organization Human Rights Watch. Since then international reports of healthcare and shelter denials to patients and medical workers alike have circulated the globe along similar acts of divisive behaviour.</p>
            <p>Zooming our lens to the Philippine setting, medical workers, and victims of the said disease here in our country are not exempted from these appalling treatments. In April alone, news of these unjust acts surfaced in the media. An ambulance driver suspected of transporting COVID-19 patients was shot in Candelaria, Quezon, a mob attacked a frontliner with bleach in Sultan Kudarat, and medical workers and patients alike found themselves turned away by eateries, denied of transportation, and evicted from their shelters - all because of unjustified COVID-19 fears. This in turn prompted the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases Spokesperson Karlo Nograles to call out these offences.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The IATF condemns these kinds of incidents and we are sternly issuing a warning that we will file cases against those who will commit acts of discrimination.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Despite this condemnation, the existence of collective anathema to discrimination will ultimately suffice our plight. For even when the global scare subsides, the psychological fallout to affected individuals will start then. While everyone shifts back to their normal lives, healthcare workers, recovered patients, and families of deceased people will start processing the experience, and weigh in what they went through.</p>
            <p>As far as the progress against discrimination goes, the pandemic exposes how we’ve barely scratched the surface of the stigma it stems from. It shows how the negative human behaviour rears its ugly head despite decades of effort in raising awareness. The virus’ impact doesn’t just end at the recovery or death of a patient nor does it stop when a pandemic ends. The discrimination from the event lingers long and spreads to victims’ minds, their families, and their friends – long enough to detrimentally affect future interactions. And when the day humanity mends back, it will be a huge relief to have conquered the pandemic with no one left behind.</p>
            <p>The emergence of the virus requires us to observe social distancing, but it never requires us to distance ourselves in extending compassion and understanding to our fellows. After all, this isn’t the first global pandemic to occur, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. Until then, our vigilance in eyeing threats shall not only be limited to viruses attacking our physical well-being, but to viruses pervading our mental health as well.</p>
