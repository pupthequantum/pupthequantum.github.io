  <p class="mb-0">I am Ira Jasper Fuentesfina, someone who goofs around and thinks of anything but studying at the best of times. Despite not thinking about studying most of the time, I can get passionate about it, it being one thing that I can somewhat brag about in my resume. I chose to write for the literary and opinion section because I think that it allows me freedom to imprint a piece of my mind onto paper for everyone to read. I hope that, through my writing, I can share my perspective.</p>
