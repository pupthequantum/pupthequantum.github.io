                <p><strong>The University of the Philippines Resilience Institute (UPRI)</strong> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jpgs.upd/"></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jpgs.upd/">Junior Philippine Geographical Society - UP Diliman</a> held its <strong>5th UPRI NOAH TALK on Resiliency</strong> with the theme “<em>Building Resilient Communities through GIS</em>” on November 29, 2019 at UP Diliman.</p>
                <p>Representatives from PUP Physics Society, Andrian Floro, Marc Casero, Alliah Santos, Ronah Rollan, McGilvyn Salvador and Vince Ordinario, were immersed with seven talks which dealt with the application and impact of <em>Geographic Information System</em> in the risk management and assessment of the country.</p>
                <p>The speakers were Ma. Criselda B. Baldago, Trixie Delmendo, Carmille Marie J. Escape, Vince Kenneth Del Mundo, Annlouise Genevieve M. Castro, Julienne Marie Espina and Ma. Bianca Perez. The talks gave insights on how science-backed information are able to help professionals and the community understand more disasters such as storms, flooding, earthquake, landslides – which are common disasters the Filipinos face.</p>
                <p>After the talks, an open forum was conducted. One of the audience asked if the City of Quezon prepared for another Ondoy and as well as the <em>Big One</em> (since the final talk tackled how Quezon City builds itself as a disaster-resilient city through science-driven governance).</p>
                <p>Ms. Perez, the final speaker, addressed the question and replied that with their increased knowledge about the risks and risk reductions, the lesser they (Quezon City) scored in the risk assessment. However, that is not something to be feared and panicked about. They are educating leaders, conducts science-backed programs and as well as learning from the previous storms and earthquakes that hit the country. With a science-backed disaster resilience, it surely increases the preparedness of the city and the country as a whole.</p>
                <p>As the event came to a conclusion, UPRI-NOAH asks for the engagement and partnership of all sectors - LGUs, schools, universities, institutions and others.</p>
                <p>As how Ms. Perez ended her talk,</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote ml-5">
                <p>“The path to resilience requires patience, understanding and<br>
                relentless commitment.”</p>
                </blockquote>
