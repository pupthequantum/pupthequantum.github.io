                <p>PUP - BS Physics alumnus and current UP PhD candidate Rhenish “Nene” Simon, introduced Python programming to the PUP Physics Society in the recently concluded three-day Online Python Workshop last Oct 26,28 and 30, 2020 via zoom.</p>
                <p>The said online workshop was initiated by Mr. Simon who offered to teach Python programming to incoming sophomore and junior Physics Society students for free.</p>
                <p>According to him, Python is a programming language which can be accessed for free, making it the language most likely to be used by the physics students of PUP.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“It’s nice to be introduced to a programming language prior to a computational physics course. And instead of just idling or watching videos online [referring to students with internet connection], why not conduct a workshop to, at least, make them feel productive,” – elaborated Simon in an interview.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Python is one of the prominent programming languages today with its applicability in numerous fields such as in scientific computations. Skills acquired in the said programming language is used from modelling and analyzing data to denser applications in computational physics, statistical mechanics, and other fields in science.</p>
                <p>Together with the alumnus, Physics Society officers, headed by Marc Casero, took the challenge to organize the first virtual workshop of the organization and at the end of the 3-day session, the feedback from the participants were impressive.</p>
                <p>More than 40 participants eagerly signed up after Physics Society posted the said event online.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“At first, I didn’t have any specific motivation in joining the workshop. Then, I found out that my friends will be joining so I joined as well. But after the workshop, I am motivated to join workshops about programming on my own,” – shared Archie Yuson, a junior student participant.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>According to Yuson, “It actually exceeded my expectations. Not only because I learned something, but that workshop served as my driving force to study more on programming. And now, I am curious and willing to learn more in that field.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Sir ‘Nene’ presented himself to act as an external research adviser for students who want to explore and produce a paper in computational physics after the last session ended.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“The Introduction to Python workshop aroused my interest (in programming and computational physics). Then, Sir Nene Simon offered to guide students in doing their paper, and I’m one of the brave souls to get in touch,” – Kherzie Andal, a sophomore student, expressed his gratitude to Sir Nene.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Students like Kherzie, who are interested in computational physics and took the challenge to explore the said field deeper, are now meeting with Sir Nene on a regular basis.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“Now, we are doing meetings, and Sir Nene has been easy to talk with—which eases the pressure. I just hope that we will meet Sir Nene’s expectations once we have done the paper,” – pointed out Kherzie.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>With the pandemic still persisting, the organization is looking forward to more collaborations with the alumni for more virtual workshops and training where physics students will acquire skills and knowledge they can apply in their college journey, research, and future careers.</p>
