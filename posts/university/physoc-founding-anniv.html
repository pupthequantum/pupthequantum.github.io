                <p>The adviser of PUP Physics Society, Mr. Cyrus J. Ayala, along with the teachers, alumni and members celebrated the society’s <strong>21st Founding Anniversary</strong> last August 24, 2019 at the <em>Los Arcos Resort, San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan</em>. The Executive Committee were the organizers of the said event.</p>
                <p>The organizers prepared fun activities wherein the members of the organization participated. In the morning activities, they prepared games for team building. Each house was split into two so that there will be more number of groups and more fun. Before the games started, each team prepared their cheer which they shouted in every end of a game. The games for this team building were <em>caterpillar race</em>, <em>sponge run</em>, <em>face powder</em> and <em>bottle to bottle</em> relay.</p>
                <p>After all the teams finished their stations, scores were tabulated and the top two teams fight for the championship. <em>Beta 1</em> and <em>Alpha 2</em> were the teams that topped the activity. The champion was determined with the game <em>tug of war</em>.</p>
                <p>In the championship round, the Executive Committee joined the game. They helped the teams to achieve the championship title. <em>Alpha 2</em> won the game and became the champion of Team Building activity.</p>
                <p><em>Physics Bluff</em>, the famous game of Physics students is the activity for the afternoon. Each house has their representative for the activity. In the end, <em>House Beta</em> gained the first place.</p>
                <p>After all the activities were finished, the Executive Committee held a socialization program. It was hosted by Lexter Gio Ranola and Eloida Mae Domingo. Before the announcement of winners, Ronah Rollan introduced <strong>“<strong>The Quantum</strong>”</strong>, the organization’s newspaper and its writers.</p>
                <p>The overall winners were announced after the introduction of The Quantum. <em>Beta 1</em> was announced as the overall champion after gaining 226 points. <em>Alpha 2</em> placed second after accumulating 171 points and <em>Gamma 1</em> placed third for having 169 points.</p>
                <p>The scores of all houses were listed below:</p>
