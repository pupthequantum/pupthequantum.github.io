                <p>A year ago, while sorting out tons of papers in E601, Marc, now the PUP - PhySoc president and I saw The Quantum publication which was published way back 2011 and the EIC that time was Mr. Ron Palacio. Then we actually had the privilege of meeting him a few days after that and discussed with him, among other things, about ‘resurrecting’ the publication after 8 years of inactivity.</p>
                <p>During its first phase of ‘resurrection’, we like to call it that way; I didn’t become the EIC until a few months because I was also the Finance Chair of the organization that time. Gifford Villanueva, our very dear and first EIC, well in our time, took the responsibility of gathering contributors and technical team. Our team was formed amidst our academic and social responsibilities and other personal matters. We pulled it all through and I am forever thankful for the hands that wrote articles and for the ancient HTML codes in our github site by John Chew.</p>
                <p>Today, we have grown bigger and well, better! Headed by our new EIC, Jem Alabado, and more active section heads and contributors, the Quantum family is finally expanding. Scouting journalists was the toughest part during the initial plan of resurrecting the publication but now, we have grown!</p>
                <p>Before I handed the responsibilities to the new EIC, we made a new logo, with the help of Kherzie Andal and some alumni whom we asked opinions and suggestions about it. We decided to merge the old logo, the nuclear model of the atom, and the logo we used in the initial launch of the Quantum last 2019, which looked like a rocket and a pen. We talked to some of the alumni who worked on the 2013 issue about the meaning behind the old logo, unfortunately, they can’t clearly tell this and that, which was totally understandable since it’s been a very long time already. I wanted to leave the meaning of the old logo off since it was the alumni’s idea and really, I don’t wanna mess it up…</p>
                <img class="section-head-image mt-2 mb-3" src="./images/logo-green.svg" style="width: 100%; height: 10rem; object-fit: fill;" alt="">
                <p>But in the long run, we decided to give it ‘our’ meaning. The Q in the middle stands for the Quantum. The two circles, in that case, electrons, represent the Physics Society today and the alumni. We will never be able to pull a single event without the alumni’s guidance. We were the first set of PhySoc officers without the guidance of Sir Luna and we were clearly lost. He was a great loss, as an adviser and friend. But the alumni came to our rescue together with our new adviser, Mr. Cyrus Ayala. We are forever grateful for all the helping hands of the alumni even if they are extremely busy with their studies and/or careers. A big shout out to Kuya Ordi, Sir JP, and Sir Ron for the relentless patience and extending their time for helping us plan out and for attending almost all of the org’s major events in the past academic year.</p>

                <p>The rocket in the middle of the old logo is what we added. It represents the magnitude of each article written and other contributions in the publication. Like a rocket, we are aiming to publish articles that will not only be seen by the Physics Society but by everyone, especially in the science field. We, the Quantum journalists, fuelled with the passion to deliver meaningful and unbiased journalism, aim to reach the stars and not just stay where gravity is pulling us down.</p>
                <p>Finally, we gave the Quantum journalists a name - Qubits. Just like how the quantum computer’s binary system works, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, we also envision ourselves like two states at the same time - a student and a responsible journalist. There’s really nothing very ‘trivial’ about it. Our main goal is to kind of have a group name we can identify ourselves in the Society, not just called ‘journalists’.</p>
                <p>Juggling academics and extras plus social and personal stuff, is challenging, like to the nth power, especially that we are trying to understand the maths and physics behind Nature. But being an officer in the org and an active Qubit, is rewarding. Totally. From learning ‘real’ time management, how to deal with yourself and with others to meeting great alumni who give advice for college and about life plus them offering superb assistance or collaborations, it was a wonderful experience I wish all students will experience.</p>
