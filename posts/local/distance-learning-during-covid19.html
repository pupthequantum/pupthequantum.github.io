            <p>With the current pandemic in the backdrop of the global stage, the education system is forced to shift to the ‘new normal’ mode of learning, paving the way not only to innovations, but inevitably to its twin complications as well. We now find ourselves wedged in a unique position between the challenge of seeking efficient ways of learning and teaching whilst dispelling truth deniers, pervasive myths, and willful ignorance in this era of uncertainty.</p>
            <img src="/assets/new-normal-education.jpg" width="3000" alt=""/><br>
            <p>In here, two contrasting images glare back as we progress on this quarantine: the democratization of science-learning and the ever-widening education gap in economically developing countries. While the dilemma poses its threat to public safety, it may have actually paved a way for a new education equalizer for all. Massive open online course (MOOC) provider giants like Coursera and EdX gained leverage and extended many of its courses to the public for free. Likewise, various webinars offered certifications to numerous educational topics without cost, aside from eradicating geographical barriers. However, for developing countries where internet connectivity is a privilege and gadgets are a luxury, education is another burden to the toiling masses.</p>
            <h2 id="science-learning-in-the-age-of-covid-19">Science-learning in the Age of COVID-19</h2><hr>
            <p>According to Oregon State University researcher Martin Storksdieck, this change of mode is a “seismic shift for those who were not already involved in distance or online education.” Perhaps suffering the greatest, if not the most ironic, from this dilemma is the STEM community. Teaching STEM requires practical and problem-solving skills for intensive application to real-world problems, which some mentors have a doubt of students achieving with the new mode.</p>
            <p>The implications of health protocols - social distancing and self-isolation measures – to science-learning communities restrict and potentially drag the progress of the rising learning curve for students and the entire academia. Concerns involve laboratory activities, field projects and collaborative works that wouldn’t be possible to carry out face-to-face – undertakings which require hands-on effort from students.</p>
            <p>Addressing one of these concerns is Nobel laureate Carl Wieman’s developed project, the Physics Education Technology (PhEt). This interactive simulations project teaches basic concepts in physics and other disciplines to students through games. PhET is increasingly contributory to science learning having increased its web traffic five times according to Director Katherine Perkins. Despite this, we must not be heavily reliant to virtual labs as a survey attested that online labs work best when projects are open-ended and the group size is small.</p>
            <p>The recurring postponement of schools and universities is an obvious indication of our gray preparedness to continue the academic year. Schools are opening sooner than later and authorities are ramming headlong into the challenge with blended learning. Suddenly, we have to implement a newly-invented mode to suit our situation. But this new approach may get worse speedily more than the probability of it getting better.</p>
            <h2 id="zooming-the-lens-to-pup">Zooming the Lens to PUP</h2><hr>
            <p>Hitting it closer to home, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines has raised eyebrows, not to mention voices, yet again with the new policies to cater its homestead of students. One of these is the questionable modular or online correspondence mode which the PUP already decided for students based on an outdated survey. This frenzy arose after the university administration released the guidelines for the opening just days before the opening of classes causing another uproar from digital have and have-nots from the school.</p>
            <p>Until now, the SIS system malfunction which caused difficulties for freshmen transferees, irregulars, etc. with their enrolment, along with the absent financial support of the admin to part-time instructors are just some of the unaddressed concerns the PUP studentry and faculty are left to face. PUP is indeed a reflection of the Philippines considering that our nation, belonging to Asia’s poor, is home to people who value education almost as they value their own lives. Vague policies cloud the discussion of the opening of classes, how much turbid will the water be when it comes to the efficiency of implementing the new mode?</p>
            <h2 id="a-conjecture-to-test">A Conjecture to Test</h2><hr>
            <p>With these situations present in our states, satisfaction is far, and perfection proves farther than we can expect it to be. But one thing is for sure, the efforts to alleviate our current education mode merely meets what we had with the face-to-face learning we’ve been accustomed to. Until the imposing ‘real’ grievances are heard, the new mode may lead to the decline in our education quality – a conjecture yet to be proven sooner than later.</p>
            <p>There is only much we can do about the situation and there is no perfect tool to carry out the new, optimal learning system. But now more than ever, when science is the only catalyst to change in our present-day condition, science-learning should be pursued stronger. After all, the pandemic isn’t the only pressing problem we are facing right now, but also the unabashed anti-science people bent on uprooting the efforts of science practitioners. We cannot afford to have our limbs paralyzed in the eyes of our learners, and go back to the dark cave where we once belonged.</p>
