            <p>When you were a kid, have you ever dreamed to become an astronaut and venture the cosmos inside a vessel off of Earth’s gravity? Schools and social media are perceived as one of the many platforms which inspires kids and even adults pursue careers in the field of space science.</p>
            <p>August 8, 2019 was the day the Philippines has officially made its ambitious leap in the space race. It was the day when President Duterte had approved the Philippine Space Agency Act under the Republic Act 11363.</p>
            <p><strong>Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA)</strong>, with its initial funding worth 10 billion spread over five years, will support the research and development programs with an aim to improve the lives of Filipinos as well as enhancing the country’s version of NASA and national security.</p>
            <p>As a further matter, it organizes the national agency in all space-related activities focusing on six developmental areas: <strong>national security and development</strong>; <strong>hazard management and climate studies</strong>; <strong>space research and development</strong>; <strong>space industry capacity-building</strong>; <strong>space education and awareness</strong>; and <strong>international cooperation</strong>.</p>
            <p>Although few are aware that space science is not new in the Philippines. In the mid 1990s, the government built a ground satellite station in Rizal and entered into a joint venture to put up the Philippine Communication Satellite (PhilComSat), had an exclusive franchise for satellite communication in Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan, and provided the equipment that allowed people in Asia to watch the Apollo 11 launch on July 16, 1969.</p>
            <p>Slowly as it moves forward for over the past decades, the space technology, with the help of other countries, had reached a major breakthrough when in April 2016, <strong>Diwata-1</strong>, the first microsatellite owned by the government and developed by Filipino engineers, was launched into orbit in space.</p>
            <p>In February 2019, Diwata-1 had captured more than 36,000 in total images, including the Manila Bay. The data using <em>landsat</em> (Land Satellite) technology helped scientists analyze the level of turbidity in the Bay and identify the sources of pollution, a month before the government launched a massive cleanup.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the other two satellites launched after Diwata-1: <strong>Maya-1</strong> June 2018 and <strong>Diwata-2</strong> in October 2018.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“When you talk about Philippine Space program, normally, the first thing that comes to mind is sending people to space,”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>said Dr. Rogel Mari Sese, an astrophysicist and one of PhilSA’s main proponents, in a TV interview.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“What we are more concerned about is bringing the benefits of space technologies and applications to the Philippines. This can come in various forms.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>These space development program, believes that PhilSA will benefit in numerous sectors in the Philippines, as it includes the defense and security for communication and surveillance, disaster management and weather forecasting, communications and broadcasting, environmental management and land use monitoring, agriculture and fisheries, as well as the transportation sector.</p>
            <p>In addition to these applications, transmitting TV signals, mobile phones and broadband, among others. The global positioning system or GPS, which is a main function in smartphones, rely on transmissions from satellites. And through remote sensing, space science also has the capability to capture satellite images that help scientists monitor environmental conditions, like an approaching storm or the impact of heat waves.</p>
            <p>With these, the Philippines will enormously improve the connectivity between the islands. Moreover, these technologies can monitor areas like the West Philippine Sea, a flashpoint for unsanctioned activities that have been threatening the country’s sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Philippine’s space age.</p>
